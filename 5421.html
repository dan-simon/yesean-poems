    English: Autumn in the north; the sun, over the equator, heads to the south.
    <br/>
    Yesean: ti jiza ru beso / tige ekuato hege / ye gudo ru kimo
    <br/>
    Literal English meaning: in north thing autumn / over equator sun / to south thing go

    Before I start to talk about the equinox (as I said last week I'd do), I'd like to make the customary grammatical notes. Specifically, note that we finally leave the hisato + chubeni structure, and in its place have one example (the second line) of the common pechapi + chubeni + chubeni structure, and two examples (the other lines) of the pechapi + hisato + ru + chubeni structure, which is the same except with hisato + ru rather than chubeni. The two hisato in the hisato + ru are north and south; note the fact that, although we have two directions, they're not the same direction. Also note that all three pechapi are locational (in = ti, over = tige, to = ye). They are all different, though they're allowed to be the same.
    <br/>
    Going on to the main topic: We know, nowadays, that Earth has two important motions: it rotates around its axis, and it revolves around the sun. As long as all we're interested in is where things appear in the sky, however, we can consider the revolving-around-the-sun part of the Earth's motion as the sun instead revolving around the Earth. This change of perspective is inconvenient if we're trying to track other things that also revolve around the sun, but for our purposes it's fine. By the way, the idea that the Earth revolves around the sun (which is correct) is called heliocentrism, and the idea that the sun revolves around Earth (which is wrong) is called geocentrism.
    <br/>
    Now we're considering Earth as rotating but staying in one place, the sun as moving around it, and the stars as staying fixed each in their own place. We call the sphere of possible positions in the sky the sun and the stars could be in the celestial sphere. Note that each position in the celestial sphere is at any given time above some place on Earth, but this place changes as Earth rotates.
    <br/>
    As it turns out, Earth's orbit around the sun (which is in our current viewpoint the sun's orbit around Earth) is more or less circular with the sun (or Earth in our current viewpoint) at the center, so the Sun's orbit around Earth is a circle in the celestial sphere. This circle is called the ecliptic. The part of the celestial sphere above the equator is well-defined, since as Earth rotates, the area above the equator does not change (if some star is above the equator it will forever be above the equator). We call this part of the celestial sphere the celestial equator. The ecliptic and the celestial equator turn out not to be the same; they're about 23.5 degrees apart. Since they're both circles on a sphere, they intersect at two points. When the sun is at one of these points, it's an equinox.
    <br/>
    But which equinox? Well, there are areas of the celestial sphere above the northern hemisphere and areas above the southern hemisphere, with the celestial equator separating these two sides, so it makes sense to talk about some point of the celestial sphere being north of the equator (meaning that it's above the northern hemisphere) or south of the equator (meaning that it's above the southern hemisphere). When the sun is going from the part of the ecliptic north of the equator to the part south of the equator, it's the autumn equinox, which occurs during autumn in the northern hemisphere. When the reverse happens (which occurs when th sun is at the other intersection of the ecliptic and the celestial equator), it's the spring equinox.
    <br/>
    We now have enough material to explain the poem. If it's autumn in the north (referring to the northern hemisphere) and the sun is over the equator (meaning that it's on the celestial equator and thus it's an equinox), it's the autumn equinox, during which, as said above, the sun is heading from north to south, or said another way, as in the poem, it heads to the south.
    <br/>
    There's more I could talk about, like seasons (that is, why it's cold and hot in different parts of the world at different times), solstices (which I haven't quite explained), the slight non-circularity of Earth's orbit, very long-term changes in Earth's orbit, cases where the geocentric model does very badly, and probably some things I didn't even put in this list. Maybe I'll cover some of these topics for the winter solstice (at least then I'll probably have to define a solstice). But this post is already very long.
    <br/>
    By the way: "ekuato" is a borrowing from English. The original Yesean term for the equator is "lapu hahe", which means "red path". Why was the equator considered red? In old Chugoku culture (I say "Chugoku" since using "China" in a Yesean context is a bit weird given what happened with "Shina" over the last few cycles) there was a system of element-color-direction correspondences including red-south-fire. So the equator, which was south of Chugoku and Yese and is a path around the Earth, was called "red path". Later "ekuato" was borrowed, and is the general term in use for scientific purposes.
    <br/>
    What follows is a long digression for those who don't know what happened with "Shina" over the last few cycles, which you should read if and only if you want to understand why I'm using Chugoku. About five cycles ago, "Shina" became a Yesean term for China (I'm using "China" in this paragraph because the wording is weird otherwise) based on the Old European "Sinae", which a Yesean historian heard when interrogating an Italian missionary and decided to use as a term for China in general (previously, it seems from my scant etymological research, only terms for specific dynasties existed).
    <br/>
    With the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty at the start of the last cycle, however, China considered "Shina" to be an overly foreign term (before than, China was considering making it the official name) and wanted to be called by the official name "Chuka Minkoku," with the short form "Chugoku". This had the influence of making "Shina" less and less official in Yese over time, while as Yese became more and more imperialistic against various countries, including China, "Shina" became more and more derogatory as considered by the Chinese.
    <br/>
    With the Asian War, China finally said enough was enough, and demanded that Yese stopped using "Shina" (it didn't help that the similar-sounding word "shine" meant a branch, subtly implying that China was a branch of Yese). Yese did, and started using "Chugoku", which, since this blog is somewhat Yese-focused as opposed to China-focused, is the name I'll use from now on.
    <br/>
    [Pretty much all of the above seems to be true from my reading of Wikipedia, just with different pronunciations (although "Shina" and "Chugoku" are indeed the Japanese names for China), and rather than "shine" meaning "branch", the "shi" character in "shina" is the radical for "branch" (I've purposely left the Yesean writing system ambiguous and didn't want to commit myself, so I used a different explanation). Now that I know the real-world history (which you can find by looking up "shina china japan"), I do think referring to "China" in a context relating to Japan and Japanese history is a little bit weird, and will probably try not to do it in certain contexts. And about "Old European" rather than "Latin" and "Asian War" rather than "Second World War": eventually I'll get into those issues.]
