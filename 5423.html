    English: The branch fell; it sits in the water, which flows slowly.
    <br/>
    Yesean: mi shine horo / ti choni luzi / bodi moge
    <br/>
    Literal English meaning: branch fall / in water sit / slow flow

    We have two pechapi + chubeni + chubeni lines here, and we finally see the subject marker mi. We also see shine meaning branch, which I mentioned last week in the context of Chugoku. [It's nice that I saw a fallen branch in the last few days so I could do this, isn't it?] We also have one hisato + chubeni, which can be thought of either as a noun with an adjective describing it ("a slow flow") or as a verb with an adverb describing it ("flowing slowly"). In the first line, we see an implicit past tense (the branch sits in the water after it falls). Note that the first line could have been "ro mi horo shine", which would refer to the branch (which is still there) rather than the falling (which is over), but in general when there's a choice about whether to use ro or not in a role juleku, not using ro is chosen.

    Before we get on to the main topic today, I'd like to talk about "luzi". It means "sit", but it is somewhat metaphorical; as we see here, it can apply to objects, and it really just means to stay in one place for a long time (as "sit" can in English). To cover the more literal meanings of "sit", there are actually two words. "chodiyi" means to sit on the ground or on a cushion, while "jopezu" means to sit on a chair-like object, such as a chair itself or a bed. Finally, "bete" means to rest, of which sitting is often a special case, but "bete" also (as in English) includes things like sleeping and lying down.
    <br/>
    The main topic today is actually not a topic, it's a puzzle. The way this works is that I post a puzzle which has a word or phrase as the solution, and you (the likely entirely hypothetical reader) try to find the word or phrase. The puzzle shouldn't require knowledge of languages other than English or much historical knowledge, and it doesn't have anything to do with Yesean culture. [In other words, it can be solved in the real world as easily as in the world with Yese.] When you think you've figured out the puzzle you can send me a solution, and if the solution is correct and you're the first solver you get a prize. My current idea for the prize is that you get to send me a topic (within reasonable limits, as I think most topics will be) and one of the next few posts will be about that topic, but if you have a better idea for the prize that isn't too much trouble for me please tell me. In addition, when the puzzle is solved I'll post a new one within the next month (in addition to the user-chosen topic post) with the same rules, in addition to being willing to give hints on the old puzzle if asked (since someone will then have gotten the prize already). So, without further ado, here's this week's puzzle:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where does the water flow toward?
