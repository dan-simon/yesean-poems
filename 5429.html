    There are no interesting line structures, but several other interesting things are going on in this week's role juleku. We have "made of" (hamo) occuring twice (in the first and second lines). In the second line, we see "yeye", which means barrier but can be used for any type of barrier (the wall of a room, a city wall, a fence, etc). In the third line we see the word "kishu", meaning to cross. It's generally used in various grammatical forms where English might use "across". [For some reason I feel an urge to remind the reader that Yesean grammar is not necessarily based on any other grammar unless I say it is. In this case, it's not based on any other grammar.] We also see the word "nasi", which means "make" but can be used somewhat more generally to mean "cook", "write", "have" (of an idea), etc. [This is actually based on the Japanese word "tsukuru".]

    There are some higher-level comments to make about this role juleku. It was created when I saw some sticks set up behind a fence in a circle of about one foot diameter (so someone had clearly crossed the fence and made it). I only now realized that another "circle made of wood" is a tree stump, which one would "make" by cutting down a tree. I like the double meaning now that I see it, but I definitely do not encouraging cutting down trees, especially trees behind fences (or walls, or other barriers). Also, on a mathematical tangent, what I saw was actually a circle of wood (with a bit of empty space in the middle), while a tree stump would be a disk of wood. Yesean, like most other languages, seems to not usually make the distinction. [Japanese doesn't seem to either.]

    This post is going to be about the Seven Elements (robise riche) in Yesean culture. [This is not something that exists in any actual culture, as far as I know. If you look it up you get a bunch of weird results, and I suppose this post adds to that bunch, which is fine.] We already had two of them in this week's role juleku (wood and metal), so we're already doing well. To review from a parenthetical a few weeks ago, the Seven Elements are air = higa, water = choni, fire = nage, stone = tisu, metal = bobi, wood = osi, soil = noko. This post will be about the history of the Seven Elements.
    <br/>
    A long time ago, Chugoku developed a system of five sets of correspondances, each of which involved, among many other things, a direction, an element, and a season. The elements involved were wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. At about the same time, many areas around the world also developed a system of four or five elements (sometimes with and sometimes witthout correspondences): earth, water, air, fire, and space/quintessence/aether/sky (the fifth element varied and often there wasn't any). Yese combined these two systems, getting a list of seven elements: earth, water, air, fire, wood, metal, aether. [In reality, this list seems to be the most popular list of seven elements, although of course in reality there aren't that many lists of seven elements.]
    <br/>
    However, there were two modifications made to this list. Firstly, aether was removed on the grounds of there being a lot of unclarity on what exactly it was and the fact that wherever and whatever it was no one had ever touched it directly. Secondly, earth as soil was separated from earth as rock and stone, leading to the two separate elements of soil and stone. [Really, I don't understand why metal is sometimes separated from earth in systems of elements but stone isn't] Eventually, aether (called suni) was added in as an element again to a certain extent, but that's a long story, and it's still not considered a "real" element.
