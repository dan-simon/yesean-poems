    Nature is beautiful, isn't it? This poem isn't that strange grammatically or semantically, and in fact many role juleku of this sort have been written over time. That doesn't make them bad though.

    This week's poem is part of a series; that is, it is one of a few poems about the same thing. We may or may not get other poems from the series in future weeks.

    I would love to say this was a purposefully minimal post, but in fact it was made at the last minute. Hopefully I'll write a longer post in the long week. I'm glad that I can write short posts, though.

    [The long week mentioned above refers to the fact that some weeks have an extra day, the next one among them. So there will be a (short) post not in 5 days, but in 6 days, and after that we go back to a once-every-5-day schedule until the next long week.]
