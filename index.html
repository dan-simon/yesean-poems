    [Some things about this blog are not real. Most notably, Yese and Yesean language and culture are not real (they're very loosely based on that of Japan; if this seems to be cultural appropriation, please make an issue and I'll try to right the wrong). Another important thing that's not real is the calendar system. The poems are real (as much as a poem can be real), as are the stated aims.]
    <br/>
    This is the main page of my attempt to write one role juleku (the main type of small poem in Yesean tradition) per week for a cycle. I have two main aims in doing so: to write regularly about random stuff and to go out in nature more (bige, nature, is an important part of the role juleku tradition).
    <br/>
    What I try to do every week, laid out more precisely: make a post with a role juleku I wrote and haven't yet used in English, Yesean, and Yesean literal meaning, along with something else (which could be as simple as "It's surprising how much is made of rocks," but hopefully will generally be longer than that). This goal should be sufficiently non-ambitious so that I won't stop due to its difficuly.
    <br/>
    I started writing role juleku on this site in the 2708/2709 weekend, in the cycle when the World Wide Web began. Entries are under the pages {sum of current week and next week number}.html, so, for example, the first entry is under 5417.html. I plan to just keep going up (rather than considering there to be a week 0), so the last entry of the current cycle will be 10079.html and the first entry of the next cycle will be 10081.html. You can find the page of the most recent entry by looking at your calendar (or by doing binary search if you prefer).

    Edit when the second post was made: I didn't include my email. Concatenate the abbreviation for deuterium, that for element 99, the value of 5! multiplied by the square of 2, shift-2 on an American keyboard, the first letter of the furthest known planet in the solar system, the last letter of the closest known planet in the solar system, the first letter of the second-furthest known planet in the solar system, a period, and the anagram of "due" that makes sense in context. As a checksum, running sum(ord(i) ** 2 for i in "put your answer here between the quotes intead of this dummy text") in python gives 122102. If you're a human, you're trying to email me, and you're having trouble emailing me given this information, then open an issue.

    Another edit when the second post was made: While I was writing the second entry, I decided that it was best to have links to all the entries in one place, and to have a tag system, so now you can find the most recent entry more easily and see which entries have which tags. These utilities are at contents.html. Maybe one week I'll write up a description of the script I use to generate it.
